In this assignment, you’ll be working with files and directories in Linux. Your task is to
write the following C programs:
• ls: list contents of a directory ls.c
• find: find files/directories matching a pattern find.c
• tree: print files/directories as a tree tree.c

• You can assume that inputs will be correctly formatted and that all commands will be a
single line of input.
